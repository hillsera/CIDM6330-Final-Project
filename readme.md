# CIDM 6330 Final Project
## Sera Hill

### Selected Domain
My selected domain for this project is a Learning Platform employers can provide to their employees so that employers can choose a learning path that let's them build new skills, or pursue paths that will help them in their current role.

The employee should be able to select their path, watch the prescribed videos, save their progress or change paths. 

### Domain Model
My domain model is LearningPath which allows for video ID, Title, Duration, and Progress. 

### Commands
I have an "add path command" that lets employers add learning paths for their employees.
There is also a "list path command" that allows employees to see the list of learning paths allowed for them.
The tests in the "projectarch" directory shows these commands working as expected.
